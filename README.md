# Who-lies

It's a simple multiplayer card game. Each player can make a statement before showing their cards. 
Other people can make a judgement if the other players' statement is true. If the judgement is correct, 
the one who make the statement should take off all the cards in the stack. If the judgement is wrong, 
the one who make the judgement should take off all the cards in the stack(YES! THIS IS GAMBLING).

Recently, I am re-developing this game in Python, since current version is base on Centos 6.7. It's not so easy to deployed,
and this toy need a UI. Another thing is that I need to write a english document for this game. You can read the whole details in the 
document if you can understand Chinese :).
